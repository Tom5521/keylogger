# Keylogger

I was bored, and wanted to do something interesting to show off to my school mates.

I am 90% sure that some of them are going to misuse it, but it is under MIT
license so I am not responsible for their actions with my software.

This project is not the best example of effective go or good project
organization, I did it in a hurry and with the sole purpose of making it work,
so don't expect the code to be of high quality.
